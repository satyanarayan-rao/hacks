#hacks

Here I keep template functions which can be used to fasten trivial preprocessings using different programming languages, for example, R. 
Often we analyze data using scatter plots, density plot etc. Here I provide abstract methods to do these jobs in an easier manner. 

Enjoy using these small and useful template functions!
